    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Whenever you make these cookies for someone, be sure to bring along
      several copies of the recipe! You will be asked for it, I promise! NOTE: I
      make icing with confectioners' sugar and milk. I make it fairly thin, as I
      'paint' the icing on the cookies with a pastry brush. Thin enough to
      spread easily but not so thin that it just makes your cookies wet and runs
      off.

      <li>1 ½ cups butter, softened</li>
